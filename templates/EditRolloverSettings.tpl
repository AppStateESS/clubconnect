<p>The Rollover Process will roll from <strong>{FROM_TERM}</strong> to <strong>{TO_TERM}</strong>.  If this does not look right, please contact Electronic Student Services.</p>
<p>Please review the organization list below.  Checked organizations will roll their registrations and their administrators.  Unchecked organizations will not be registered in the new term.  <strong>Please make sure to click "Save Changes" at the bottom if you check or uncheck any organization.</strong></p>
<p><strong>This process is difficult to undo.</strong>  Please only click this button when you're ready to actually change live terms.</p>
